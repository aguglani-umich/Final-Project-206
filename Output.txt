Detroit Airport Covid Vectors for 24 Hours

A vector is an origin point for COVID-19 coming to the Detroit Airport.
We look at positivity rate of the origin for all direct flights to Detroit.
For each airport, we look at the frequency of flights between that airport and DTW and the associated positivity rate in the surrounding state to assign a scaled COVID score to each origin airport.
This allows us to show where, from around the country, COVID is coming to Detroit from.
Then a scale is then used to classify the danger level of each associated vector.
